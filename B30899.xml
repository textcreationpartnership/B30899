            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE ACCOUNT OF A most Terrible Storm of Thunder and Lightning, that happened at <hi>Cruise Morchard,</hi> four Miles distant from <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> on <hi>Monday,</hi> being the 18th of <hi>February</hi> last past, about one of the Clock in the Morning.</head>
            <p>THE Publisher not intending to delay the Reader from perusing the following Relation, with an Harangue of attributing it to be the effects of Natural Causes, or as a Judgment of an Angry Deity, for Crimes either General or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, leaves all to their own Censure, and only sets forth the true matter of Fact, which take as followeth.</p>
            <p>That on Monday, the 18th of <hi>February</hi> last past, about One of the Clock in the Morning, <hi>John Cruise</hi> Esq; whose House is very near adjacent to the said Parish Church, with his whole Family, as well as the whole adjacent Country, being much affrighted with the terribleness of the Thunder and Lightning, and the appearance of the whole Element being in a Flame; and hearing a strange noise of Flames, imagined it to be his own House; but endeavouring to find out the certainty thereof, quickly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192106:2"/> with astonishment discover'd that the Parish Church, and Tower thereof were all on Fire; and continu'd burning with that violence (till the whole were entirely consum'd) that 'tis difficult for Pen to express the same. The Bells in the Tower were so melted (excepting half of one) that the very substance of the Metal was turn'd into perfect Dross, and made useless to be remelted. Which Accident is the more admirable for the Season it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in, when the least part of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is accounted Wonderful.</p>
            <p>I hope none will be difficult to give credit to what is here related, for that the said Gentleman hath written a particular thereof to two Members of this present Parliament, of the said Town adjacent; and an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Dammage, which is computed to be near Two Thousand Pound. Who likewise are desir'd to procure a Brief for a publick Collection of Charity towards the rebuilding of the said Parish Church, so dismally consum'd.</p>
            <p>There was also much more dammage done in the adjacent Country, by blowing up Trees by the Roots, the Roofs off some Houses, and Thatch off others; of which the particulars are not yet taken.</p>
